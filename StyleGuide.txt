Please follow these conventions as much as possible to reduce clutter. Thanks

source files end in .c
header files end in .h

file format order:
    -#include headers
    -#defines/#typedefs
    -global constants/variables
    -functions
    
struct example {
	//the curly braces should begin on the same line as the function/struct
}

Capitalization/naming:
file names: <PascalCase>
#DEFINE: <ALL_CAPS>
struct/unions: <PascalCase> (match file name)
variables/functions: <camelCase>

Tips:
Give descriptive names (avoid 1/2 letter variables, except as index variables)
Avoid ambiguous abbreviations (eg. "serialOuptutThread" instead of "soThread")
Names should make clear which sensor is involved (eg. "imuGetValue" instead of "getValue")
